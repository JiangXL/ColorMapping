+ The computer(Mrs. Huangs') and microscope are settled on the desktop.
+ HDMI cable and usb cable link to camera and computer.
+ 芯片 and 注射器 has sodium fluorescin inside,
+ The programe *Colormaping* and *Mapping* can work.

Here are two major part of hardware in our projet. Microfluidics and light
modulator.(指着说) Because we can not take from Shenzhen to boston, we build
this microscope in 3 days.

(Start show the structure(channel, gaussal palter) of microfluidic)

First, this is one of  microfluidic chip used in our experiment. Here is interval
structure of microfluidic. Normally, we inject the *C. elegans* into chip. But
a fluorescence dye(sodium fluorescin) is used rather than *C. elegans* for
 safty. You can see the green fluorescence of dye.

(Then push the liquid into the channel to show the change) When we push the
syringe, the liquid moves also.

Just like the slder show, we design the device called light modulator. To`
control the light, our light modulator can control in both time and space   
dimenion rather the tranditional fluorescence microscope light source just can
in time dimention. Here a modified projector as a light source. We control the
light spot from projector to side. As you can see, the light spot move with
the rectange.

If these is a problem, we will show these two movie.

## Detail
## Conent
To be a better experience, we prepare a demonstration of
fluorescence microscope and microfluidic for everyone. For our
experiment we design and make lots of hardware, including
microfluidics and light modulator. Microfluidics provide a
platform to strict the behavior of C. elegans, and light
modulator can modulate the pattern of light in time and space.
We use the fluorescence microscope in experiments, but it is
difficult to take our big fluorescence from Shenzhen to Boston.
To show the function and results of our light modulator.  We build
a mini fluorescence microscope with a mini projector.  You can see here.
(指着说)Camera, objective, di-mirror, microfluidics, and our projector.
Firstly, we will show inside of microfluidic. In the order to show
clear and beautiful image, we inject the  solution of sodium
fluorescein into microfluidics rather than the buffer called M9,
which is used in our experiments. You can see the channels very clear.

Then we will show how the light modulator work. In light modulator
work. For light modulator, projector is a red and blue light source,
which can form different pattern in space and time. We code a
software suit to control the projector. Here are 4 rectangle,
which indicate the place of C. elegans. All of the 4 rectangle
an move and resize, and are projected light with difficult
color and intensity. Based on special algorithm, software
will generate special image, which will be projected into
microscope. Then the light from projector will focr
