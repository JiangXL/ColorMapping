# Q&A

## Why we use projector as a light source?
Because we want to illuminate the sample pixel by pixel. We can
stimulate different worm with different wavelength and intensity light
in one view. Finally, we can consturect a maze with bule and red
light. C. elegans will will move based on the pattern.

The projector can form a local, dynamicaly, multi-color pattern in
slide.

## How do you build the optical system?

We replace the oring lens with longer force distance lens to resize
 the image into microscope. The addtional red and blue filter are
  added after LCD.

We also develop a software to control the pattern on slide. The
softeare is coded by PYthon, Qt5 and other package. It have been on
 different platform, windows and ArchLinux.

## Did you test your device?

Yes, we have tested the projector light source. You can see that,
we just pull the our picture into microscope. Then we play on
movie, we can see these.

## Does anyone make the simlar device?

Yes, other companys have devloped similar device. But our light
modulator has shorter deleying time and dual-wavelength choice for projectoring
pattern. Plus, this haredware and software are open source and cheap.
Everyone can build this light modulator by themselves according to
our guidebook.
